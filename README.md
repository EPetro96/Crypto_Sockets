# Crypto_Sockets

Operating Systems Lab Course Project #3, NTUA

A cryptographic device for the virtualization environment QEMU-KVM. A chat app in which users communicate through TCP/IP protocol, using the BSD Sockets API. The app supports end to end cryptoghraphic messages using the cryptodev userspace API. The chatting app can then be run in a QEMU-KVM Virtual Machine using a cryptographic VirtIO device we created.
